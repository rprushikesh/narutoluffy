Scrimgeour,Reporters,"These are dark times, there is no denying.Our world has, perhaps,faced no greater threat than it does today.But I say this to our citizenry:We, ever your servants…...will continue to defend your liberty…...and repel the forces that seek to take it from you. Your Ministry remains......strong.",1

Hermoine,Mrs. Granger,"Coming, Mom.",3
Vernon,Dudley,"Come on, Dudley, hurry up.",4
Dudley,Vernon,I still don't understand why we have to leave.,5
Vernon,Dudley,"Because, unh, it's not safe for us here anymore.",6
Molly,Ron,"Ron, tell your father supper's nearly ready.",7
Mr. Granger,Mrs. Granger,Is this in Australia?,8
Mrs. Granger,Mr. Granger,"Looks wonderful, doesn't it?",9
Hermoine,SPELL,Obliviatespell,10
Voldermort,Snape,"Snape. I was beginning to worry you had lost your way. Come, we've saved you a seat. You bring news, I trust?",11
Snape,Voldermort,"It will happen Saturday next, at nightfall.",12
Yaxley,Voldermort,"I've heard differently, my Lord. Dawlish, the Auror, has let slip that the Potter boy…...will not be moved until the 30th of this month. The day before he turns 17.",13
Snape,Voldermort,This is a false trail. The Auror Office no longer plays any part in the protection of Harry Potter. Those closest to him believe we have infiltrated the Ministry.,14
Voldermort,Plus,"What say you, Pius?",15
Plus,Voldermort,"One hears many things, my Lord. Whether the truth is among them is not clear.",16
Voldermort,Plus,"Heh. Spoken like a true politician. You will, I think, prove most useful, Pius.",17
Voldermort,Snape,"Where will he be taken, the boy?",18
Snape,Voldermort,"To a safe house. Most likely the home of someone in the Order. I'm told it's been given every manner of protection possible. Once there, it will be impractical to attack him.",19
Bellatrix,Voldermort,Ahem. My Lord. I'd like to volunteer myself for this task. I want to kill the boy.,20
Voldermort,Wormtail,Wormtail! Have I not spoken to you about keeping our guest quiet?,21
Wormtail,Voldermort,"Yes, my Lord. Right away, my Lord.",22
Voldermort,Bellatrix,"As inspiring as I find your bloodlust, Bellatrix…...I must be the one to kill Harry Potter.",23
Voldermort,All,"But I face an unfortunate complication. That my wand and Potter's share the same core. They are, in some ways, twins. We can wound, but not fatally harm one another. If I am to kill him…...I must do it with another's wand. Come, surely one of you would like the honor? Mm?",24
Voldermort,Lucius,"What about you, Lucius?",25
Lucius,Voldermort,My Lord?,26
Voldermort,Lucius,My Lord? I require your wand.,27
Voldermort,Lucius,Do I detect elm?,28
Lucius,Voldermort,"Yes, my Lord.",29
Voldermort,Lucius,And the core?,30
Lucius,Voldermort,"Dragon. Ahem. Dragon heartstring, my Lord.",31
Voldermort,All,"To those of you who do not know......we are joined tonight by Miss Charity Burbage…...who, until recently, taught at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Her specialty was Muggle Studies.",32
Voldermort,All,"It is Miss Burbage's belief that Muggles are not so different from us. She would, given her way…...have us mate with them. To her, the mixture of magical and Muggle blood is not an abomination…...but something to be encouraged.",33
Burbage,Snape,"Snape. Snape, please. We're friends.",34

Voldermort,Nagini,Nagini. Dinner.,36
Hagrid,Harry,"Hello, Harry.",37
Harry,Ron,All right. Wow.,38
Harry,Hermoine,Hello.,39
Hagrid,Harry,You're looking fit.,40
Moody,Hagrid,"Yeah, he's absolutely gorgeous. What say we get undercover before someone murders him?",41
Harry,Moody,Evening,42
Harry,Shacklebolt,I thought you were looking after the Prime Minister.,43
Shacklebolt,Harry,You are more important.,44
Bill Weasely,Harry,Hello Harry. Bill Weasely.,45
Harry,Bill Weasely,Oh. Pleasure to meet you.,46
Fred,Harry,He was never always this handsome. ,47
George,Harry,Dead Ugly,48
Bill Weasely,George,True Enough,49
Bill Weasely,Harry,"Owe it all to a werewolf, name of Greyback. Hope to repay the favor one day.",50
Fleur,Bill,"You're still beautiful to me, Bill.",51
Lupin,Harry,"Just remember, Fleur, Bill takes his steaks on the raw side now. ",52
Nymphadora,Harry,"By the way, wait till you hear the news. Remus and l…",53
Moody,All,All right. We'll have time for a cozy catch-up later. We've got to get the hell out of here. And soon.,54
Moody,Harry,"Potter, you're underage, which means you've still got the Trace on you.",55
Harry,Moody,What's the Trace?,56
Moody,Harry,"If you sneeze, the Ministry will know who wipes your nose. We have to use those means of transport the Trace can't detect: Brooms, Thestrals and the like. We go in pairs. That way, if anyone's out there waiting for us, and I reckon there will be…...they won't know which Harry Potter is the real one.",57
Harry,Moody,The real one?,58
Moody,Harry,I believe you're familiar with this particular brew.,59
Harry,Moody,No. Absolutely not.,60
Hermoine,Moody,I told you he'd take it well.,61
Harry,Moody,"No, if you think I'm gonna let everyone risk their lives for me, l…",62
Ron,Harry,"Never done that before, have we?",63
Harry,Ron,"No. No. This is different. I mean, taking that, becoming me. No.",64
Fred,Harry,"Well, none of us really fancy it, mate.",65
George,Harry,"Imagine if something went wrong, and we ended up a scrawny, specky git forever.",66
Moody,Harry,"Everyone here is of age, Potter. They've all agreed to take the risk.",67
Moody,Harry,"Technically, I've been coerced. Moody Fletcher, Mr. Potter. Always been a huge admirer",68
Moody,Moody,"Nip it, Moody",69
Moody,Hermoine,"All right, Granger, as discussed.",70
Harry,Hermoine,"Blimey, Hermoine",71
Moody,Hermoine,"Straight in here, if you please",72
Moody,All,"For those of you who haven't taken Polyjuice Potion before, fair warning: It tastes like goblin piss.",73
Fred,Moody,"Have a lot of experiences with that, do you, Mad-Eye? Just trying to diffuse the tension.",74
George,Fred,"Wow, we're identical.",75
Moody,George,"Not yet, you're not.",76
George,Moody,"Haven't got anything a bit more sporting, have you?",77
Fred,Moody,I don't really fancy this color.,78
Moody,Fred,"Well, fancy this, you're not you. So shut it and strip.",79
Moody,Moody,"All right, all right.",80
Moody,Harry,"You'll need to change too, Potter.",81
Fleur,Bill Weasely,"Bill, look away. I'm hideous.",82
Ron,Bill Weasely,I knew she was lying about that tattoo.,83
Hermoine,Harry,"Harry, your eyesight really is awful.",84
Moody,All,"Right, then. We'll be pairing off. Each Potter will have a protector.",85
Moody,Moody,"Moody, stick tight to me. I wanna keep an eye on you.",86
Moody,Harry,"As for Harry, where the devil are you anyway?",87
Harry,Moody,Here,88
Moody,Harry,You'll ride with Hagrid.,89
Hagrid,Harry,I brought you here 16 years ago when you were no bigger than a Bowtruckle. Seems only right that I should be the one to take you away now.,90
Moody,Hagrid,"Yes, it's all very touching. Let's go.",91
Moody,All,Head for the Burrows. We'll rendezvous there. On the count of three.,92
Hagrid,Harry,"Hold tight, Harry.",93
Moody,All,One......two…...three!,94
Harry,Hagrid,"Hagrid, we have to help the others!",95
Hagrid,Harry,"I can't do that, Harry. Mad-Eye's orders. Hang on.",96
Harry,SPELL,Stupefyspell,97
Hagrid,Harry,"Hang on, Harry.",98
Voldermort,Harry,Harry ,99
Molly,Harry,Harry,100
Molly,Hagrid,Hagrid,101
Molly,Hagrid,What happened? Where are the others?,102
Harry,Molly,Is no one else back?,103
Hagrid,Molly,"They were on us right from the start, Molly. We didn't stand a chance.",104
Molly,Hagrid,"Well, thank goodness you two are all right. ",105
Hagrid,Molly,The Death Eaters were waiting for us. It was an ambush.,106
Ginny,Harry,Ron and Nymphadora should've already been back. Dad and Fred as well.,107
Lupin,Harry,Here! Quick. Into the house.,108
Ginny,Lupin,What are you doing?,109
Lupin,Harry,What creature sat in the corner......the first time Harry Potter visited my office in Hogwarts?,110
Harry,Lupin,Are you mad?!,111
Lupin,Harry,- What creature?!,112
Harry,Lupin,A Grindylow.,113
Lupin,All,We've been betrayed. Voldemort knew you were being moved tonight. I had to make sure you weren't an impostor.,114
Lupin,Harry,Wait,115
Shacklebolt,Lupin,The last words Albus Dumbledore spoke to the pair of us?,116
Lupin,Shacklebolt,Harry is the best hope we have. Trust him.,117
Shacklebolt,Harry,What gave you away?,118
Harry,Shacklebolt,"Hedwig, I think. She was trying to protect me.",119
Ron,Hermoine,Thanks,120
Nymphadora,Hermoine,"Deserves that. Brilliant, he was. I wouldn't be standing here without him.",121
Hermoine,Nymphadora,Really?,122
Ron,Hermoine,Always the tone of surprise.,123
Arthur,Lupin,We the last back?,124
Fred,Lupin,Where's George?,125
Fred,George,"How you feeling, Georgie?",126
George,Fred,Saint-like.,127
Fred,George,Come again?,128
George,Fred,"Saint-like. I'm holy. I'm holey, Fred. Get it?",129
Fred,George,"The whole wide world of ear-related humor and you go for ""I'm holey."" That's pathetic.",130
George,Fred,Reckon I'm still better-Iooking than you.,131
Bill Weasely,All,Mad-Eye's dead. Moody took one look at Voldemort and Disapparated.,132
Dumbledore,Harry,This is beyond anything I imagined,133
Harry,Dumbledore,They could be hidden anywhere.,134
Harry,Dumbledore,if you did destroy each Horcrux…,135
Dumbledore,Harry,One destroys Voldemort,136
Voldermort,Ollivander,"You lied to me. Lied to me, Ollivander",137
Ron,Harry,Going somewhere?,138
Harry,Ron,Nobody else is going to die. Not for me.,139
Ron,Harry,"For you? You think Mad-Eye died for you? You think George took that curse for you? You may be the Chosen One, mate, but this is a whole lot bigger than that. It's always been bigger than that.",140
Harry,Ron,Come with me,141
Ron,Harry,"What, and leave Hermoine? You mad? We wouldn't last two days without her. Don't tell her I said that. Besides, you've still got the Trace on you. - We've still got the wedding…",142
Harry,Ron,"I don't care about a wedding. I'm sorry. No matter whose it is. I have to start finding these Horcruxes. They're our only chance to beat him…...and the longer we stay here, the stronger he gets.",143
Ron,Harry,"Tonight's not the night, mate. We'd only be doing him a favor. Do you think he knows? I mean, they're bits of his soul, these Horcruxes. Bits of him. When Dumbledore destroyed the ring, you destroyed Tom Riddle's diary…...he must have felt something. To kill the other Horcruxes, we have to find them. Where are they? Where do we start?",144
Fred,Ron,Ready when you are.,145
Arthur,Ron,Please pay attention! It's your brother's wedding. Buck up.,146
Ginny,Harry,"Zip me up, will you? It seems silly, doesn't it, a wedding? Given everything that's going on.",147
Harry,Ginny,Maybe that's the best reason to have it......because of everything that's going on.,148
George,Harry,Morning,149
Arthur,All,"Come on, keep up. All together now. One, two, three. ",150
Arthur,Fred,"How's it looking at your end, boys?",151
George,Arthur,Brilliant,152
George,All,Bloody hell. What's the Minister of Magic doing here?,153
Harry,Scrimgeour,"To what do we owe the pleasure, Minister?",154
Scrimgeour,Harry,"I think we both know the answer to that question, Mr. Potter.",155
Ron,Scrimgeour,And this is?,156
Scrimgeour,All,Herein is set forth the last will and testament…...of Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. ,157
Scrimgeour,Ron,"First, to Ronald Bilius Weasley…...I leave my Deluminator…...a device of my own making…...in the hope that, when things seem most dark…...it will show him the light.""",158
Ron,Scrimgeour,Dumbledore left this for me?,159
Scrimgeour,Ron,Yeah ,160
Ron,Scrimgeour,Brilliant. What is it? Wicked.,161
Scrimgeour,Hermoine,To Hermione Jean Granger...I leave my copy of The Tales of Beedle the Bard…in the hope that she find it entertaining and instructive.,162
Ron,All,"Mom used to read me those. The Wizard and the Hopping Pot. Babbitty Rabbitty and the Cackling Stump. Come on, Babbitty Rabbitty. No?",163
Scrimgeour,Harry,To Harry James Potter….I leave the Snitch he caught in his first Quidditch match at Hogwarts…as a reminder of the rewards of perseverance...and skill.,164
Harry,Scrimgeour,"Is that it, then?",165
Scrimgeour,Harry,"Not quite. Dumbledore left you a second bequest: The sword of Godric Gryffindor. Unfortunately, the sword of Gryffindor was not Dumbledore's to give away. As an important historical artifact, it belongs…",166
Hermoine,Scrimgeour,To Harry. It belongs to Harry. It came to him when he needed it in the Chamber of Secrets.,167
Scrimgeour,Hermoine,"The sword may present itself to any worthy Gryffindor. That does not make it that wizard's property. And, in any event, the current whereabouts of the sword are unknown.",168
Harry,Scrimgeour,Excuse me?,169
Scrimgeour,Harry,"The sword is missing. I don't know what you're up to, Mr. Potter…...but you can't fight this war on your own. He's too strong.",170
Luna,Harry,"Hello, Harry. I've interrupted a deep thought, haven't I? I can see it growing smaller in your eyes.",171
Harry,Luna,"Of course not. How are you, Luna?",172
Luna,Harry,Very well. Got bitten by a garden gnome only moments ago. ,173
Lovegood,Harry,Gnome saliva is very beneficial. We live just over the hill.,174
Harry,Lovegood,"Pleasure to meet you, sir.",175
Lovegood,Harry,"I trust you know, Mr. Potter, that we at the Quibbler.....unlike those toadies at the Daily Prophet ...fully supported Dumbledore in his lifetime…...and, in his death, support you just as fully.",176
Harry,Lovegood,Thank you.,177
Luna,Lovegood,"Come, Daddy. Harry doesn't want to talk to us right now. He's just too polite to say so.",178
Harry,Elphias,"Excuse me, sir? May I sit down?",179
Elphias,Harry,Mr. Potter. By all means. Here.,180
Harry,Elphias,Thanks. I found what you wrote in the Daily Prophet really moving. You obviously knew Dumbledore well.,181
Elphias,Harry,"Well, I certainly knew him the longest. That is, if you don't count his brother, Aberforth…...and somehow, people never do seem to count Aberforth.",182
Harry,Elphias,I didn't even know he had a brother.,183
Elphias,Harry,"Well, Dumbledore was always very private, even as a boy.",184
Muriel,Elphias,"Don't despair, Elphias. I'm told he's been thoroughly unriddled by Rita Skeeter…...in 800 pages, no less. Word has it that someone talked to her. Someone who knew the Dumbledore family well. Both you and I know who that is, Elphias.",185
Elphias,Muriel,A monstrous betrayal.,186
Harry,Muriel,Who are we talking about?,187
Muriel,Harry,Bathilda Bagshot.,188
Harry,Muriel,Who?,189
Muriel,Harry,"My God, boy......she's only the most celebrated magical historian of the last century. She was as close to the Dumbledores as anyone. Oh, I'm sure Rita Skeeter thought it well worth a trip to Godric's Hollow…...to take a peek into that old bird's rattled cage.",190
Harry,Muriel,Godric's Hollow? Bathilda Bagshot lives at Godric's Hollow?,191
Muriel,Harry,"Well, that's where she first met Dumbledore.",192
Harry,Muriel,You don't mean to say he lived there too?,193
Muriel,Harry,"The family moved there after his father killed those three Muggles. Oh, it was quite the scandal. Honestly, my boy, are you sure you knew him at all?",194
Shacklebot,All,The Ministry has fallen. The Minister of Magic is dead. They are coming. They are coming. They are coming,195
Elphias,Harry,"Nice meeting you, Mr. Potter.",196
Harry,Ginny,Ginny!,197
Lupin,Harry,Harry! Go!,198
Ron,Hermoine,Where are we?,199
Hermoine,Ron,Shaftesbury Avenue. I used to come to the theater here with Mom and Dad. I don't know why I thought of it. It just popped into my head. This way.,200
Hermoine,All,We need to change,201
Ron,Hermoine,How the ruddy?,202
Hermoine,Ron,Undetectable Extension Charm.,203
Ron,Hermoine,"You're amazing, you are.",204
Hermoine,Ron,Always the tone of surprise.,205
Harry,Ron,What about all the people at the wedding? Do you think we should go back?,206
Ron,Harry,They were after you. We'd put everyone in danger by going back.,207
Hermoine,Harry,Ron's right.,208
Waitress,Hermoine,"Ahem, Coffee?",209
Hermoine,Waitress,"A cappuccino, please.",210
Waitress,Ron,You?,211
Ron,Waitress,What she said,212
Harry,Waitress,Same,213
Ron,Harry,So where do we go from here? Leaky Cauldron?,214
Hermoine,Ron,"It's too dangerous. If Voldemort has taken over the Ministry, none of the old places are safe. Everyone from the wedding will have gone underground, into hiding.",215
Harry,Hermoine,"My rucksack with all my things, I've left it at the Burrow. You're joking.",216
Hermoine,Harry,"I've had all the essentials packed for days, just in case.",217
Ron,Hermoine,"By the way, these jeans, not my favorite.",218
Harry,Ron,Down!,219
Harry,SPELL,Stupefyspell,220
Dolohov,SPELL,Expulsospell,221
Hermoine,SPELL,PetrificusTotalusspell,222
Hermoine,Waitress,Go! Leave,223
Harry,Ron,"Lock the door, get the lights. This one's name is Rowle. He was on the Astronomy Tower the night Snape killed Dumbledore.",224
Ron,Harry,This is Dolohov. I recognize him from the wanted posters.,225
Ron,Dolohov,"So, what we gonna do with you, hey?  Kill us if it was turned round, wouldn't you?",226
Harry,Ron,"If we kill them, they'll know we were here.",227
Hermoine,Ron,Ron,228
Ron,Hermoine,Suppose he did Mad-Eye. How would you feel then?,229
Harry,Ron,It's better we wipe their memories.,230
Ron,Harry,You're the boss.,231
Ron,Hermoine,Hermione......you're the best at spells.,232
Hermoine,SPELL,Obliviatespell,233
Harry,Hermoine,How is it they knew we were there?,234
Hermoine,Harry,Maybe you still have the Trace on you?,235
Ron,Hermoine,Can't be. Trace breaks at 17. It's wizarding law. What?,236
Hermoine,Harry,"We didn't celebrate your birthday, Harry. Ginny and I, we prepared a cake. We were going to bring it out at the end of the wedding.",237
Harry,Hermoine,"I appreciate the thought, but given the fact that we were almost killed…...by a couple of Death Eaters a few minutes ago…",238
Hermoine,Harry,Right. Perspective.,239
Ron,Harry,"We need to get off the streets, get somewhere safe.",240
Ron,Hermoine,What was that all about?,241
Hermoine,Ron,"Probably Mad-Eye's idea, in case Snape decided to come snooping.",242
Hermoine,SPELL,Homenumreveliospell,243
Hermoine,All,We're alone.,244
Ollivander,Voldermort,I believed another wand..,245
Voldermort,Ollivander,You lied to me.,246
Ollivander,Voldermort,"It makes no sense. I believed a different wand would work, I swear. There must be another way.",247
Ron,All,"Harry? Hermione, where are you? I think I've found something.",248
Hermoine,Ron,Lovely. Regulus Arcturus Black.,249
Ron,Harry,R.A.B.,250
Harry,All,I know I will be dead long before you read this. I have stolen the real Horcrux and intend to destroy it.,251
Ron,Harry,R.A.B. Is Sirius's brother.,252
Hermoine,Ron,"Yes. Question is, did he actually destroy the real Horcrux?",253
Harry,Kreacher,"You've been spying on us, have you?",254
Kreacher,Harry,Kreacher has been watching.,255
Hermoine,Harry,Maybe he knows where the real locket is.,256
Harry,Kreacher,Have you ever seen this before? Kreacher?,257
Kreacher,Harry,It's Master Regulus' locket.,258
Harry,Kreacher,"But there were two, weren't there? Where's the other one?",259
Kreacher,Harry,Kreacher doesn't know where the other locket is.,260
Hermoine,Kreacher,"Yes, but did you ever see it? Was it in this house?",261
Kreacher,Hermoine,Filthy Mudblood. Death Eaters are coming - ,262
Hermoine,Ron,Ron,263
Kreacher,Ron,"Blood traitor, Weasley.",264
Harry,Kreacher,Answer her,265
Kreacher,Harry,Yes. It was here in this house. A most evil object.,266
Harry,Kreacher,How do you mean?,267
Kreacher,Harry,"Before Master Regulus died, he ordered Kreacher to destroy it…...but no matter how hard Kreacher tried, he could not do it.",268
Harry,Kreacher,"Well, where is it now? Did someone take it?",269
Kreacher,Harry,"He came in the night. He took many things, including the locket.",270
Harry,Kreacher,"Who did? Who was it, Kreacher?",271
Kreacher,Harry,Moody. Moody Fletcher.,272
Harry,Kreacher,Find him,273
Plus,All,"As your new Minister for Magic......I promise to restore this temple of tolerance…...to its former glory. Therefore, beginning today…...each employee will submit themselves…...for evaluation. But know this: You have nothing to fear…...if you have nothing to hide.",274
Hermoine,Ron,Be a bit gentler,275
Hermoine,Harry,"They have flesh memories. When Scrimgeour first gave it to you, I thought it might open at your touch. That Dumbledore had hidden something inside it.",276
Dobby,Harry,"Harry Potter, so long it's been.",277
Kreacher,Harry,"As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief…...Moody Fletcher.",278
Hermoine,SPELL,Expelliarmusspell,279
Moody,Harry,What you playing at? Setting a pair of bleeding house-elves after me.,280
Dobby,Harry,"Dobby was only trying to help. Dobby saw Kreacher in Diagon Alley, which Dobby thought was curious. And then Dobby heard Kreacher mention Harry Potter's name. And then Dobby saw Kreacher ...talking with the thief, Moody…",281
Moody,Dobby,I'm no thief. You foul little... Git.,282
Moody,Harry,I'm a purveyor of rare and wondrous objects.,283
Ron,Moody,"You're a thief, Dung. Everyone knows it.",284
Dobby,Ron,"Master Weasley, so good to see you again.",285
Moody,All,"Listen, I panicked that night, all right? Could I help it if Mad-Eye fell off his broom?",286
Kreacher,Moody,You…,287
Hermoine,Moody,Tell the truth,288
Harry,Moody,"When you turned this place over...Don't deny it. You found a locket, am I right?",289
Moody,Harry,Why? Was it valuable?,290
Hermoine,Moody,You still got it?,291
Ron,Hermoine,"No, he's worried he didn't get enough money for it.",292
Moody,All,"Bleeding give it away, didn't I? There I was, flogging me wares in Diagon Alley…...when some Ministry hag comes up and asks to see me license. Says she's a mind to lock me up. And would've done it too, if she hadn't taken a fancy to that locket.",293
Harry,Moody,Who was she? The witch. Do you know?,294
Moody,All,"Well, she's there. Look. Bleeding bow and all.",295
Hermoine,Harry,"Right, remember what we said. Don't speak to anyone unless absolutely necessary.",296
Hermoine,Ron,"Just try and act normal. Do what everybody else is doing. If we do that, then with a bit of luck, we'll get inside.",297
Harry,Hermoine,This is completely mental,298
Hermoine,Harry,Completely,299
Ron,Hermoine,The world's mental. Come on…...we've got a Horcrux to find.,300
Ron,Harry,We flush ourselves in. That's bloody disgusting.,301
Harry,Hermoine,Are those?,302
Hermoine,Harry,"Muggles, In their rightful place.",303
Ron,Harry,"Gotta tell you, I'm starting to freak out a bit.",304
Harry,Hermoine,"How long did you say this batch of Polyjuice would last, Hermione?",305
Hermoine,Harry,I didn't.,306
Harry,Ron,"Ron, you don't have a wife.",307
Ron,Harry,But how do I stop it raining?,308
Hermoine,Ron,"Try  FiniteIncantatemspell. This is you, Ron.",309
Ron,Hermoine,And if that doesn't work?,310
Harry,Hermoine,If we don't locate Umbridge within the hour…...we go find Ron and come back another day. Deal?,311
Hermoine,Harry,Yes,312
Harry,SPELL,Acciolocketspell,313
Harry,Ron,"Ron, it's me.",314
Ron,Harry,"Harry. Blimey, forgot what you looked like. Where's Hermione?",315
Harry,Hermoine,"She's gone down to the courtrooms, with Umbridge.",316
Ron,Harry,Bloody cold down here.,317
Umbridge,Mary,"Mary Elizabeth Cattermole? Of 27 Chislehurst Gardens, Great Tolling, Evesham? Mother to Maisie, Ellie and Alfred? Wife to Reginald?",318
Mary,Umbridge,Yes,319
Umbridge,Mary,A wand was taken from you upon your arrival at the Ministry today. Is this that wand? Would you please tell the court from which witch or wizard you took this wand?,320
Mary,Umbridge,"I didn't take it. I got it in Diagon Alley, at OIlivander's, when I was 11. It chose me.",321

Hermoine,Ron,Shh. Shh.,335
Hermoine,Harry,Quickly. It's all right. Unstopper it.,336
Harry,Hermoine,"Hermione, his arm.",337
Hermoine,Harry,"I know, just do it.",338
Hermoine,Ron,"It's okay. Okay, it's gonna sting a little bit.",339
Harry,Hermoine,What happened? I thought we were going back to Grimmauld Place,340
Hermoine,Harry,We were,341
Hermoine,Ron,"It's all right. One more, one more.",342
Hermoine,Harry,"We were there, we were there, but Yaxley had hold of me, and I…I knew once he'd seen where we were, we couldn't stay…...so I brought us here…...but Ron got splinched.",343

Hermoine,Harry,What are you doing?,357
Harry,Hermoine,We have to keep it safe until we find out how to destroy it.,358
Ron,Harry,"Seems strange, mate. Dumbledore sends you off…...to find all these Horcruxes, but doesn't tell you how to destroy them. Doesn't that bother you?",359
Voldermort,Harry,"You know the spell, Harry.",360
Voldermort,Gregorovitch,Tell me. Tell me Gregorovitch,361
Gregorovitch,Voldermort,It was stolen from me.,362
Voldermort,Gregorovitch,Who was he? The thief?,363
Gregorovitch,Voldermort,It was a boy. It was he who took it. I never saw it again. I swear on my life.,364
Voldermort,Gregorovitch,I believe you.,365
Voldermort,SPELL,AvadaKedavraspell,366
Hermoine,Harry,"I thought it had stopped. You can't keep letting him in, Harry.",367
Harry,Hermoine,You-Know-Who has found Gregorovitch.,368
Hermoine,Harry,The wandmaker?,369
Harry,Hermoine,"He wants something that Gregorovitch used to have…...but I don't know what. But he wants it desperately. I mean, it's as if his life depends on it.",370
Hermoine,Harry,Don't. It comforts him,371
Harry,Hermoine,"It sets my teeth on edge. What's he expecting to hear, good news?",372
Hermoine,Harry,I think he just hopes he doesn't hear bad news.,373
Harry,Hermoine,How long before he can travel?,374
Hermoine,Harry,I'm doing everything I can.,375
Harry,Hermoine,You're not doing enough!,376
Hermoine,Harry,"Take it off. I said, take it off now. Better?",377
Harry,Hermoine,Loads,378
Hermoine,Harry,"We'll take it in turns, okay?",379
Scabior,Man,What's that? What's that smell? What you doing?,380
Man,Scabior,It's heavy,381
Scabior,Man,"Oh, sorry. Do you want me to carry it?",382
Man,Scabior,"Yeah, thank you.",383
Scabior,Man,Don't be ridiculous. Pick it up.,384
Harry,Hermoine,Snatchers. Good to know your enchantments work.,385
Hermoine,Harry,He could smell it. My perfume. I've told you…...Ron isn't strong enough to Apparate.,386
Harry,Hermoine,"Well, then, we'll go on foot. And next time, Hermione, as much as I like your perfume, just don't wear any.",387
Harry,Hermoine,Oh. Thank you.,388
Ron,Hermoine,"He doesn't know what he's doing, does he?",389
Hermoine,Ron,None of us do.,390
Hermoine,Harry,"Oh, my God.",391
Harry,Hermoine,What?,392
Hermoine,Harry,I'll tell you in a minute.,393
Harry,Hermoine,Maybe you could tell me now.,394
Hermoine,Harry,"The sword of Gryffindor, it's goblin-made.",395
Harry,Hermoine,Brilliant,396
Hermoine,Harry,"No, you don't understand. Dirt and rust have no effect on the blade. It only takes in that which makes it stronger.",397
Harry,Hermoine,Okay,398
Hermoine,Harry,"Harry, you've already destroyed one Horcrux, right? Tom Riddle's diary in the Chamber of Secrets.",399
Harry,Hermoine,With a Basilisk fang. If you tell me you've got one of those…...in that bloody beaded bag of yours…,400
Hermoine,Harry,"Don't you see? In the Chamber of Secrets, you stabbed the Basilisk with the sword of Gryffindor. Its blade is impregnated with Basilisk venom.",401
Harry,Hermoine,It only takes in that which makes it stronger.,402
Hermoine,Harry,"Exactly, which is why",403
Harry,Hermoine,It can destroy Horcruxes,404
Hermoine,Harry,That's why Dumbledore left it to you in his will.,405
Harry,Hermoine,"You are brilliant, Hermione. Truly.",406
Hermoine,Harry,"Actually, I'm highly logical, which allows me to look past extraneous detail…...and perceive clearly that which others overlook.",407
Harry,Hermoine,"Yeah, there's only one problem, of course.",408
Ron,Harry,"The sword was stolen. Yeah, I'm still here. But you two carry on. Don't let me spoil the fun.",409
Harry,Ron,What's wrong?,410
Ron,Harry,"Wrong? Nothing's wrong. Not according to you, anyway.",411
Harry,Ron,"Look, if you've got something to say, don't be shy. Spit it out.",412
Ron,Harry,"All right, I'll spit it out. But don't expect me to be grateful…...because there's another damn thing we've gotta find.",413
Harry,Ron,I thought you knew what you signed up for.,414
Ron,Harry,Yeah. I thought I did too.,415
Harry,Ron,"Well then, I'm sorry, but I don't quite understand. What part of this isn't living up to your expectations? Did you think we were gonna be staying in a hotel? Finding a Horcrux every other day? Thought you'd be back by Christmas?",416
Ron,Harry,"I just thought, after all this time…...we would've achieved something. I thought you knew what you were doing. I thought Dumbledore told you something worthwhile. I thought you had a plan",417
Harry,Ron,"I told you everything that Dumbledore told me. And In case you haven't noticed, we found a Horcrux.",418
Ron,Harry,"Yeah, and we're as close to getting rid of it as we are to finding the rest of them.",419
Hermoine,Ron,Ron please take…Take the Horcrux off. You wouldn't be saying this…if you hadn't been wearing it all day.,420
Ron,Harry,"Want to know why I listen to that radio? To make sure I don't hear Ginny's name, or Fred, or George or Mom.",421
Harry,Ron,You think I'm not listening? You think I don't know how this feels?!,422
Ron,Harry,"No, you don't know how it feels! Your parents are dead. You have no family.",423
Hermoine,Ron,Stop. Stop,424
Harry,Ron,"Fine, then go! Go, then! Fine.",425
Hermoine,Ron,Ron,426
Ron,Hermoine,And you? Are you coming or you staying? Fine. I get it. I saw you two the other night.,427
Hermoine,Ron,"Ron, that's... That's nothing. Ron…Ron, where are you going? Please, come back. Ron. Ron!",428

Harry,SPELL,salviohexiaspell,431
Harry,Hermoine,"Hermione. Hermione? You were right. Snitches have flesh memories…...but I didn't catch the first Snitch with my hand, I almost swallowed it.",432
Hermoine,Harry,I open at the close,433
Harry,Hermoine,What do you think that means?,434
Hermoine,Harry,"I don't know. I found something as well. At first I thought it was an eye, but now I don't think it is. It isn't a rune, and it isn't anywhere in Spellman's Syllabary. Somebody inked it in. It isn't part of the book. Somebody drew it.",435
Harry,Hermoine,Luna's dad was wearing that at Bill and Fleur's wedding.,436
Hermoine,Harry,Why would someone draw it in a children's book?,437
Harry,Hermoine,"Look, Hermione, I've been thinking. I want to go to Godric's Hollow. It's where I was born. It's where my parents died.",438
Hermoine,Harry,That's exactly where he'll expect you to go because it means something to you.,439
Harry,Hermoine,"Yeah, but it means something to him too, Hermione. You-Know-Who almost died there. I mean, isn't that exactly the type of place he'd be likely to hide a Horcrux?",440
Hermoine,Harry,"It's dangerous, Harry. But even I have to admit, recently I've been thinking we'll have to go there. I think it's possible something else is hidden there.",441
Harry,Hermoine,What?,442
Hermoine,Harry,"The sword. If Dumbledore wanted you to find it, but didn't want it in the Ministry's hands…...where better to hide it than the birthplace of the founder of Gryffindor?",443
 Harry,Hermoine,Hermoine,444
Hermoine,Harry,Don't ever let me give you a haircut again. I still think we should've used Polyjuice Potion.,445
Harry,Hermoine,No. This is where I was born. I'm not returning as someone else.,446
Hermoine,Harry,"Harry, I think it's Christmas Eve. Listen.",447
Harry,Hermoine,"Do you think they'd be in there, Hermione? My mom and dad.",448
Hermoine,Harry,"Yeah, I think they would.",449
Hermoine,SPELL,Ignotus Peverell,450
Hermoine,Harry,"Hey, Harry?",451
Harry,Hermoine,"Merry Christmas, Hermione.",452
Hermoine,Harry,"Merry Christmas, Harry. Harry, there's someone watching us. By the church.",453
Harry,Hermoine,I think I know who that is.,454
Hermoine,Harry,"I don't like this, Harry.",455
Harry,Hermoine,"Hermione, she knew Dumbledore. She might have the sword. This is where they died, Hermione. This is where he murdered them.",456
Harry,Bathilda,"You're Bathilda, aren't you? Here, let me do that. Miss Bagshot, who is this man?",457
Hermoine,Harry,Harry.,458
Harry,SPELL,Lumosspell,459

Hermoine,SPELL,Confringospell,461
Hermoine,Harry,Are you feeling better?,462
Harry,Hermoine,"You've outdone yourself this time, Hermione.",463
Hermoine,Harry,"The Forest of Dean. I came here once with Mom and Dad, years ago. It's just how I remember it. The trees, the river, everything. Like nothing's changed.  Not true, of course. Everything's changed. If I brought my parents back here now, they probably wouldn't recognize any of it. Not the trees, not the river…...not even me.  Maybe we should just stay here, Harry. Grow old. You wanted to  know who the boy in the photograph was. I know. Gellert Grindelwald. ",464
Harry,Hermoine,"He's the thief I saw in Gregorovitch's Wand Shop. Speaking of which, where is my wand? Where's my wand, Hermione?",465
Hermoine,Harry,"As we were leaving Godric's Hollow, I cast a curse and it rebounded. I'm sorry. I tried to mend it, but wands are different",466
Harry,Hermoine,Its done. Leave me yours. Go inside and get warm. I'll take the locket as well.,467

Harry,Ron,It was you?,473
Ron,Harry,"Well, yeah. Bit obvious, I think.",474
Harry,Ron,"And you cast the doe as well, did you?",475
Ron,Harry,"No, I thought that was you",476
Harry,Ron,"No, my Patronus is a stag",477
Ron,Harry,Right. Yeah. Antlers.,478
Harry,Ron,"Okay, Ron. Do it.",479
Ron,Harry,I can't handle it. That thing affects me more than it affects you and Hermione.,480
Harry,Ron,All the more reason,481
Ron,Harry,No. I can't.,482
Harry,Ron,"Then why are you here? Why did you come back? Now, I'll have to speak to it in order for it to open. When it does, don't hesitate. I don't know what's in there, but it'll put up a fight. The bit of Riddle that was in that diary tried to kill me.",483
Ron,Harry,All right. ,484
Voldermort,Ron,"I have seen your heart, and it is mine. I have seen your dreams, Ronald Weasley…and I have seen your fears. Least loved  by your mother, who craved a daughter. Least loved  by the girl who prefers your friend.",485
Harry,Ron,"Ron, kill it!",486
Voldermort,Ron,We were better without you. Happier without you. Who could look at you compared to Harry Potter? What are you compared with the Chosen One?,487
Harry,Ron,"Ron, it's lying!",488
Voldermort,Ron,Your mother confessed she would have preferred me as a son. What woman would take you? You are nothing. Nothing. Nothing compared to him.,489
Ron,Harry,Just think......only three to go.,490
Harry,Hermoine,Hermoine?,491
Hermoine,Harry,Is everything all right?,492
Harry,Hermoine,"It's fine. Actually, you know, it's more than fine.",493
Ron,Hermoine,Hey.,494
Hermoine,Ron,"You complete ass, Ronald Weasley! You show up here after weeks, and you say ""hey""? Where's my wand? Where's my wand?",495
Harry,Hermoine,I don't know ,496
Hermoine,Harry,"Harry Potter, give me my wand",497
Harry,Hermoine,I don't have it,498
Ron,Hermoine,How come he's got your wand?,499
Hermoine,Ron,Never mind why he's got my wand. What is that? You destroyed it. And how is it that you just happen to have the sword of Gryffindor?,500
Harry,Hermoine,It's a long story.,501
Hermoine,Ron,Don't think this changes anything.,502
Ron,Hermoine,"Oh of course not. I only just destroyed a bloody Horcrux. Why would that change anything? Look, I wanted to come back as soon as I left. I just didn't know how to find you.",503
Harry,Ron,"Yeah, how did you find us?",504
Ron,Harry,"With this. It doesn't just turn off lights. I don't know how it works, but Christmas morning I was sleeping in this little pub…...keeping away from some Snatchers..and I heard it.",505
Harry,Ron,It?,506
Ron,Hermoine,"A voice...your voice, Hermione…coming out of it.",507
Hermoine,Ron,And what exactly did I say may I ask?,508
Ron,Hermoine,"My Name. Just my name .Like a whisper. So I took it, clicked it, and this tiny ball of light appeared. And I knew. And sure enough, it floated toward me, the ball of light ...went right to my chest, straight through me. Right here. And I knew it was gonna take me  where I needed to go, so I Disapparated......and came to this hillside. It was dark. I had no idea where I was. I just hoped that one of you would show yourself. And you did.",509
Ron,Harry,I've always liked these flames Hermione makes. How long do you reckon she'll stay mad at me?,510
Harry,Ron,"Well, just keep talking about that little ball of light touching your heart…...and she'll come round.",511
Ron,Harry,"It was true. Every word. This is gonna sound crazy…...but I think that's why Dumbledore left it to me, the Deluminator. I think he knew that somehow I'd need it to find my way back, and she'd lead me. Bloody hell, I just realized, you need a wand, don't you?",512
Harry,Ron,Yeah,513
Ron,Harry,"I've got one here. It's a blackthorn. Ten inches. Nothing special, but I reckon it'll do. Took if off a Snatcher a couple of weeks ago. Don't tell Hermione this, but they're a bit dim, Snatchers. This one was definitely part troll, the smell of him.",514

Harry,SPELL,Reduciospell,516
Hermoine,Harry,What's going on in there?,517
Ron,Hermoine,Nothing,518
Hermoine,Harry,We need to talk.,519
Ron,Hermoine,"Yeah, all right.",520
Hermoine,Harry,I want to see Xenophilius Lovegood,521
Harry,Hermoine,Sorry?,522
Hermoine,Harry,"See this? It's a letter Dumbledore wrote to Grindelwald. Look at the signature. It's the mark again. It keeps cropping up. In Beedle the Bard,  in the graveyard in Godric's Hollow.",523
Harry,Hermoine,It was there too. Outside Gregorovitch's Wand Shop.,524
Ron,Harry,But what does it mean?,525
Hermoine,Harry,"Look, you've got no idea where the next Horcrux is, and neither do I…...but this, this means something. I'm sure of it.",526
Ron,Harry,Yeah. Hermione's right. We ought to see Lovegood. Let's vote on it. Those in favor?,527
Harry,Hermoine,"You're not still mad at him, are you? ",528
Hermoine,Harry,I'm always mad at him.,529
Lovegood,Hermoine,What is it? Who are you? What do you want?,530
Harry,Lovegood,"Hello, Mr. Lovegood. I'm Harry Potter. Could we come in?",531
Hermoine,Lovegood,Where is Luna?,532
Lovegood,Hermoine,She'll be along.,533
Lovegood,Harry,"So how can I help you, Mr. Potter?",534
Harry,Lovegood,"Well, actually...It was about something you were wearing round your neck at the wedding. A symbol.",535
Lovegood,Harry,You mean this?,536
Harry,Lovegood,"Yes. That exactly. What we've wondered is, what is it?",537
Lovegood,Harry,"What is it? Well, it's the sign of the Deathly Hallows, of course.",538
Ron,Lovegood,The what?,539
Hermoine,Lovegood,The what?,540
Lovegood,Ron,Deathly Hallows,541
Lovegood,Hermoine,Deathly Hallows,542
Lovegood,Ron,I assume you're all familiar with The Tale of the Three Brothers.,543
Lovegood,Hermoine,I assume you're all familiar with The Tale of the Three Brothers.,544
Lovegood,Harry,I assume you're all familiar with The Tale of the Three Brothers.,545
Ron,Lovegood,Yes ,546
Hermoine,Lovegood,Yes ,547
Harry,Lovegood,No,548
Hermoine,Harry,I have it in here.,549
Hermoine,Harry,"There were once three brothers......who were traveling along a Ionely, winding road at twilight.",550
Ron,Hermoine,"Midnight. Mom always said ""midnight."" ",551
Ron,Harry,"Midnight. Mom always said ""midnight."" But ""twilight's"" fine. Better, actually.",552
Hermoine,Ron,Do you want to read it?,553
Ron,Hermoine,No its fine,554
Lovegood,Harry,So there you are. Those are the Deathly Hallows.,555
Harry,Lovegood,"I'm sorry, sir. I still don't quite understand.",556
Lovegood,Harry,"Where's that pen I had? The Elder Wand. The most powerful wand ever made. The Resurrection Stone. The Cloak of Invisibility. Together, they make the Deathly Hallows. Together, they make one master of Death.",557

Lovegood,Hermoine,Uh... Uh….. Ignotus... Excuse me... . And his brothers...Cadmus and Antioch…are thought to be the original owners of the Hallows…...and therefore the inspiration for the story. Uh... Uh…But your tea's gone cold. I'll be right back.,561

Lovegood,Hermoine,"No, you can't!",571
Harry,Lovegood,Sir?,572
Lovegood,Harry,"You're my only hope. They were angry, you see, about what I'd been writing. So they took her. They took my Luna. My Luna. But it's really you they want.",573
Harry,Lovegood,"Who took her, sir?",574
Lovegood,Harry,Voldemort.,575
Ron,Harry,That treacherous little bleeder. Is there no one we can trust?,576
Harry,Ron,They kidnapped her because he supported me. He was just desperate.,577
Ron,Harry,I'll do the enchantments.,578
Voldermort,Grindelwald,"Tell me, Grindelwald. Tell me where it is.",579
Grindelwald,Voldermort,"Hello, Tom. I knew you would come one day…...but surely you must know I no longer have what you seek.",580
Voldermort,Grindelwald,Tell me who possesses it.,581
Grindelwald,Voldermort,"The Elder Wand lies with him, of course…...buried in the earth. Dumbledore.",582

Bellatrix,Draco,Well?,585
Draco,Bellatrix,I  can't be sure.,586
Lucius,Draco,"Draco. Look closely, son. If we are the ones to hand Potter over to the Dark Lord…...everything would be forgiven. All would be as it was, you understand?",587
Draco,Lucius,"Now, we won't be forgetting who actually caught him, I hope, Mr. Malfoy.",588
Lucius,Draco,You dare to talk to me like that in my own house?,589
Bellatrix,Draco,"Don't be shy, sweetie. Come over. Now, if this isn't who we think it is, Draco, and we call him, he'll kill us all. We need to be absolutely sure.",590
Draco,Bellatrix,What's wrong with his face?,591
Bellatrix,Scabior,"Yes, what is wrong with his face?",592
Scabior,Bellatrix,"He came to us like that. Something he picked up in the forest, I reckon.",593
